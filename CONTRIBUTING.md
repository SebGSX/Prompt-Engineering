# Contributing to Prompt Engineering

Thank you for considering contributing to the [Prompt Engineering](https://github.com/SebGSX/Prompt-Engineering) project. This repository aims to provide
production-ready prompts for AI-assisted code and work item reviews. The prompts emphasize security, standards, 
maintainability, and acceleration of high-quality deliverables. Contributions should align with the stated ethos by 
promoting rigorous, responsible, and effective use of AI in professional contexts.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SebGSX/Prompt-Engineering/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

### Substance over Form

Contributions are welcome as are corrections. The author follows Crocker's Rules. Direct, honest, and constructive
feedback is appreciated. Please submit a pull request with your changes or an issue with your feedback.

### Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Provide a clear title and description, including reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, and 
  relevant context (e.g., AI model version, prompt used, hyperparameter settings, etc.).
- Use labels appropriately (e.g., bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.).

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/new-prompt`).
2. Ensure changes align with project objectives: enhance prompt effectiveness, improve code quality in `src` or 
   `test` directories, or refine documentation.
3. For prompts: Validate through exhaustive testing, focusing on accuracy, depth, and adherence to security and 
   maintainability principles. Include evidence of testing in the PR description.
4. For code: Follow best practices in the relevant language; ensure thread safety where applicable; add or update tests.
5. Commit messages should be concise and descriptive, following conventional commits (e.g., `feat: add new prompt 
for design reviews`).
6. Update documentation (e.g., README.md) if changes impact usage.
7. Submit the pull request with a detailed description, referencing related issues.

### Style and Conventions

- *Prompts:* Use clear, structured Markdown; limit domain to ensure probabilistic accuracy.
- *Code:* Adhere to standard linters (e.g., PEP8 for Python); prioritize readability and efficiency.
- *Documentation:* Formal tone; emphasize accountability, policy compliance, and AI limitations.
